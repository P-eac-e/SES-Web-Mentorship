Well, I'm quite trying to kick out the imposter syndrome in me now that this is just but my first encounter with Github. Well, other times when out in need of
different codes, a simple Google search with "Github" specified brings up what I need. At least most of the time. But I've never quite got to understand the intricacies of
Github. Not that I do now anyway. But let's hope this leap to learn this new world leads to an amazing outlook on all this part of the universe has to offer. So don't laugh if
perhaps, you can smell the rookie in me.

So about today and [How the Internet Works](https://youtu.be/7_LPdttKXPc?si=uV32esR7VBzWQkwc) I've got to learn quite a number of stuff I
thought I knew enough about. I could just annoy you with some of the bits I found interesting.
* The internet is simply just a wire. Well at least before you get to dive into it's technicalities, as is the case with almost everything
* The internet has a very sane structure that ensures a seamless flow of information, and I should be glad that my boss can never get to learn of the detours I take when boredom strikes because of these structures.

At least I wrote something. Might be forced, might not, but I got myself to do it. And I hope to do this for the next 3 months in the SES Web Mentorship Program. And so, may the good journey begin, or "May the odyssey 
begin" as the poet in me is crying to say!
